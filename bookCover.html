                The book cover which I made shows many different aspects of the novel, represented through the pictures and the colors which I chose to incorporate. To begin, the most obvious part of my design is the main image, which shows a picture of a silhouette of an average person becoming a superhero in the virtual reality headset. In Ready Player One, a virtual reality game called the OASIS dominated their world. Many people work, learn, and get entertainment from the OASIS. In the OASIS you can choose your own avatar, be whoever you want to be. This is shown in the image, as just any regular person can be a superhero in the Oasis.

                This also represents the story's main character, Wade. As in real life Wade does not have a great life, and while he may not be the richest person in the OASIS, he still prefers to be there than in real life. This is also represented by the colors which I chose for my cover. For example, the background is a dark and gloomy red to black gradient. This represents how the real world is very dark and gloomy and plagued with poverty, hunger, and pollution.

            <div class="card card-2">
                However, in the VR headset there is a much lighter green color. This is supposed to show how for Wade, and for many others in their world, the OASIS is an escape from reality. However, the green color is actually a gradient which fades back into red. The reasoning behind this choice is that even in the OASIS there are many problems. One of the biggest examples of these problems is the “sixers” which are people who work for an organization which are attempting to take over the OASIS and turn it into a paid service. This shows how greed still exists, even in the OASIS, which is an escape for many.

                This design also connects to my essential question, which is “What has more of an effect on shaping a person--the environment or an individual’s nature?” The way which my design connects to the essential question is that it shows how, in the novel, people may act differently when in the OASIS or in real life. For example, in the OASIS, our main character Wade is a very confident person. However, in real life, Wade is shown to be more timid, and when he went to school he would picked on much more. This shows how his environment is shaping him to act differently. However, this doesn’t only apply to Wade, as it's shown in the novel that many people choose avatars which look completely different from what someone looks like in real life. This is shown in the book cover with the super hero, as this could represent both someone's personality or their physical appearance changing.
