                The design choices and text shown in the book review strongly reflect the essential question of “What has more of an effect on shaping a person--the environment or an individual’s nature?” (Gaccione and Getrajdman 1). This is greatly shown throughout the beginning and end quotes provided. This is due to the fact that these quotes give a great example of how the main character, Wade Watts, changes throughout the different environments in which he is found throughout the book. For example, it is shown that Wade Watts is a very shy person. This is shown in the first quote, which shows how Wade Watts is extremely shy in real life. This is contrasted by the end quote, which shows how, when in the OASIS, Wade Watts is a very confident person. This greatly shows how Wade Watts is more shaped by his environment than his nature, which directly answers the research question.

                Additionally, the book review makes many claims about the pros and cons of the story. These pros are shown throughout the novel. For example, the book shows a lot of 80s references, which is one of the pros that was mentioned as a lot of references. Another pro mentioned was worldbuilding; the story greatly showed how the OASIS worked and how it interacted with the real world, as well as providing a lot of political commentary on the world's situation. However, one con that was mentioned was that there was not much character development within the story, which is shown as none of the characters are really shown to change throughout the story. The relationships between the characters change. However, the characters themselves are very static. Another con that was mentioned is that Ready Player One is a simple story, which is shown as the themes in this story are very simple, which is that corporate greed is bad. Overall, the pros and cons highlighted in the book review reflect actual interpretations of the story.
