                The design choices and text shown in the book snap strongly reflect the essential question of “What has more of an effect on shaping a person--the environment or an individual’s nature?” (Gaccione and Getrajdman 1). First, this is shown within the text, which is highlighted and presented in the book snap. For example, the section of text in the top half of the book snap, or the half that is supposed to represent anxiety, shows the main character, Wade Watts, being very anxious and unable to socialize in the real world. This is shown in the quote, “I was a painfully shy kid, with low-self esteem and almost no social skills” (Cline). This quote shows how in the real world, or specifically in school, Wade was very shy and unconfident in himself. Wade is shown to be a very anxious and socially awkward kid in real life, which is a strong contrast to how Wade acts within the OASIS.

                When in the OASIS, Wade is confident in what he does and is fine with people relying on him. For example, in a scene near the end of the book, when Wade is in the third gate, he has the entire world watching him and he is still confident in his actions. This is shown within the bottom half of the book snap, which is supposed to represent confidence, or how he acts in the Oasis. This is shown in the quote, “I grabbed the sword and used it to slay all three of the dragons, opened the gates of Black Castle, and ventured into the labyrinth” (Cline). When this quote took place, Wade had the entire world watching him, and despite that, he was confident in his actions and himself. This starkly contrasts how he acted in the real world, where Wade was too nervous to speak to his peers. Overall, this shows how the text shown within the book snap answers the essential question, by showing how Wade is more confident in the OASIS than in real life by showing how he is changed by his environment.
