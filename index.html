                <p>	An individual's environment has a much more significant effect on shaping them than their nature. This is significantly shown throughout the novel Ready Player One by Ernest Cline. Ready Player One is a story about a futuristic world where a popular virtual reality software called the OASIS is used as a second reality, and to many, as their primary reality. In this version of the future which is dominated by a virtual reality world, it is shown how many individuals act differently when placed inside the OASIS. Overall, this proves how, at least in this novel, an individual is greatly shaped by their environment. This is shown through the main character Wade Watts, a high school student who spends most of his time in the OASIS. For example, it is shown how when discussing how Wade acted at school in real life, Cline wrote, “I was a painfully shy, awkward kid, with low self-esteem and almost no social skills—a side effect of spending most of my childhood inside the OASIS. Online, I didn’t have a problem talking to people or making friends. But in the real world, interacting with other people— especially kids my own age—made me a nervous wreck” (Cline 35). This shows how much Wade is affected and shaped by his environment. As in real life, Wade is very shy, unconfident, and struggles with communicating with people his age. However, in the OASIS, Wade is a very confident person who is able to make friends and talk to people without having social anxiety. This shows how Wade is being shaped by his environment, as in one situation, his personality is completely different from when in another. Wade’s nature is not shown here, as he is shown to act very differently in these situations, which shows how the environment is shaping him much more than his nature. Overall, this shows how Wade not showing a clear nature which is shaping him and being shown to acct very differently in different environments; Wade’s environment is shaping him much more than his individual nature.
