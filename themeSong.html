                The theme song is supposed to represent the darker times in the book. The specific time of the book which this song goes over is the period shortly after Art3mis stops talking to Wade. This is when Wade hit rock bottom in the story, and the theme song shows that by talking about these emotions that he is going through. Many of the lines in the theme song are direct references to events or things said in the book. One example of this is the line “Love destroying my heart”, which is referring to Art3mis and his feelings towards her. Additionally, the lines “If the scoreboard change I will go up to the roof Climb off the rails and let myself go”, is a direct reference to Wades plan for if the Sixers win the competition.

                Additionally, this theme song shows a great connection to my essential question. This is due to the fact that throughout the music video Wade is shown to be having many different emotions and be acting in different ways. These different emotions and actions are shown to be due to a change in his environment. The change in environment that is being portrayed to affect Wade in this song is his different position on the scoreboard and how Art3mist left his life. These changed turned him from a happy person to one who was completely depressed. This change caused him to do things which he would never before do, and consider things he would never before consider, such as suicide. This shows how my song connects to the essential question as it shows how the environment Wade is in is shaping him.
